# AKUpdateManager

AKUpdateManager manages your app updates.<br>

## Installation

AKUpdateManager can be installed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). Add the following lines to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'AKUpdateManager'
```

You can also install it using [swift package manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) as well.
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AmrKoritem/AKUpdateManager.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.1"))
]
```

## Usage

In the `AppDelegate.application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, add the following line:
```swift
    AKUpdateManager.shared.checkForUpdates()
```

AKUpdateManager will show the user an alert telling him to update his app if there was any. The alert will be blocking if the needed update is major. However, you can override AKUpdateManager response by providing your own implementation as follows:
```swift
    AKUpdateManager.shared.checkForUpdates { updateInfo in
        // Add your own implementation here.
     }
```
